# trader1- Documentation

Welcome to the trader1- documentation site. This is the landing page for the documentation built with MkDocs and the Material theme.

## Getting started

- Edit files under the `docs/` directory to add content.
- Commit and push changes to `main` (or open a PR) to trigger the Deploy Docs workflow.

---

If you want the simpler default MkDocs theme instead of Material, let me know and I will update mkdocs.yml.
